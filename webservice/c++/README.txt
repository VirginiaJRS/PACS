This folder contains the source code of the web services on http://www3.csiss.gmu.edu/GeoprocessingWS/services/ . You can learn about the backstage processing logic of those web services which are used in the image processing of PACS. 

All the code are built on GDAL. So you need to install GDAL first before you recompile these C++ code files.

The website of GDAL is: http://www.gdal.org
